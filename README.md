# floodit

A todo list

- Add stats to keep track How many games played, how many wins and loses. Create a file to keep the stats update and on going
- Add a start menu so user can select board size, amount of max moves per board size will be hard coded for each board
- Maybe add a reset button
- Pretty up the gui
- Maybe have an online aspect, not really sure what maybe a leaderboard or something
